# Chess Rankings Assignment

This project solves the SWE Round 1: Chess Rankings technical test using the public [Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api). It fetches and processes chess player data, demonstrating clean code, robust error handling, and professional software engineering practices.

## Features

- **List the top 50 classical chess players** (by username)
- **Print the last 30 days of rating history** for the top classical player
- **Generate a CSV** with the last 30 days of ratings for each of the top 50 players

## Project Structure

```
chess_rankings_assignment/
├── README.md                # This file
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
├── main.py                  # Entry point for running the assignment
├── utils.py                 # Core logic and helper functions
└── top_50_classical_ratings.csv  # Output CSV (generated by the script)
```

## Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (You only need `requests`; all other modules are from the Python standard library.)

## Usage

Run the main script:

```
python main.py
```

This will:
- Print the top 50 classical chess players' usernames
- Print the last 30 days of rating history for the top player
- Generate `top_50_classical_ratings.csv` with the rating history for all 50 players

## Output

- **CSV file:** `top_50_classical_ratings.csv`
  - The first column is the username
  - The next 30 columns are the ratings for each of the last 30 days (oldest to newest)

## Notes

- If a player did not play on a given day, their rating is carried forward from the previous day.
- The script handles network and data errors gracefully and prints helpful messages.
- The code is modular and easy to test or extend.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `requests` (see `requirements.txt`)
